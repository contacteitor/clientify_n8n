### Data You'll Receive

All webhook data is automatically flattened so you can easily access it in your workflow. Here's what you get for each event type:

**Contact Events** (`contact.created`, `contact.updated`, `contact.deleted`)
```json
{
  "event": "contact.created",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-02T15:30:00Z",
  "contact_id": 12345,

}
```
Access with: `{{$json.first_name}}`, `{{$json.email}}`, `{{$json.company_name}}`

**Company Events** (`company.created`, `company.updated`, `company.deleted`)
```json
{
  "event": "company.created",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-02T18:00:00Z",
  "company_id": 999,
  "name": "Tech Startup Inc",

### Important Notes

- **Event names are case-sensitive**: Use exact names like `contact.created` (not `Contact.Created`)
- **Webhook URLs are unique** per workflow - if you recreate a workflow, you'll get a new URL
- **Workflows must be active** for webhooks to work - inactive workflows won't receive events
- **All data includes `_raw`** field with the original payload for advanced use cases
- **Update events include `changes`** object showing what changed (old/new values)

## Troubleshooting

### Node Doesn't Appear After Installation

**Problem:** The Clientify node doesn't show up in the node panel after installing.

**Solution:**
1. **Restart n8n completely** (required for new nodes)
2. Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete or Cmd+Shift+Delete)
3. Search for "Clientify" (not the package name) in the node search
4. Verify installation in **Settings ‚Üí Community Nodes**

### Authentication Errors

**Problem:** "Authentication failed" or 401/403 errors.

**Solution:**
1. Verify your JWT token is valid and not expired
2. Check that the token has the correct permissions in Clientify
3. Ensure you're using the Clientify MCP token (not a regular API key)
4. Try creating a new credential with a fresh token

### "Missing required parameter" Errors

**Problem:** Operation fails with missing parameter errors.

**Solution:**
1. Check which fields are marked as **required** (indicated by red asterisk)
2. Some operations require specific IDs (contact_id, company_id, etc.)
3. Use `Get` operations first to retrieve IDs, then pass them to `Update` or `Delete` operations
4. Review the parameter descriptions for expected format

### Operations Return Empty Results

**Problem:** List operations return no results even though data exists.

**Solution:**
1. Check pagination parameters (page, page_size)
2. Verify your token has permission to access the requested resources
3. Try without filters first to confirm data access
4. Check the Clientify web UI to confirm data exists

### Node Execution Fails in Docker

**Problem:** Node fails with "package not found" errors in Docker environments.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure nodes directory is persisted in volumes:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n
   ```
2. Or enable auto-reinstall:
   ```yaml
   environment:
     - N8N_REINSTALL_MISSING_PACKAGES=true
   ```
3. Restart the container after installing the node

### Rate Limiting Errors

**Problem:** "Too many requests" or 429 errors.

**Solution:**
1. Add delay between operations using n8n's **Wait** node
2. Reduce the frequency of scheduled workflows
3. Batch operations where possible
4. Contact Clientify support to increase rate limits if needed

## Parameter Reference

### Common Parameters

Most operations support these common parameters:

- **page** (number): Page number for pagination (default: 1)
- **page_size** (number): Number of results per page (default: 20, max: 100)
- **sort_by** (string): Field to sort by (e.g., "created_at", "name")
- **sort_order** (string): Sort direction ("asc" or "desc")

### ID Parameters

Operations that work with specific records require an ID parameter:

- **company_id** (number): Unique identifier for a company
- **contact_id** (number): Unique identifier for a contact
- **deal_id** (number): Unique identifier for a deal
- **task_id** (number): Unique identifier for a task

## Advanced Usage

### Combining Multiple Operations

Create powerful workflows by chaining operations:

```
Trigger ‚Üí Search Companies ‚Üí Create Contact ‚Üí Create Deal ‚Üí Create Task
```

### Error Handling

Use n8n's built-in error handling:

1. Enable **"Continue On Fail"** in node settings
2. Add an **IF** node to check for errors
3. Route errors to notification nodes (Email, Slack, etc.)

### Data Transformation

Use n8n's **Code** or **Function** nodes to transform data between operations:

```
List Contacts ‚Üí Code Node (transform) ‚Üí External API
```
